# graphql-docs Changelog

A concise overview of the public-facing changes to the gem from version to version. Does not include internal changes to the dev experience for the gem.

## Unreleased

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

This release upgrades three major dependencies with significant breaking changes.

#### Dependency Upgrades
- **commonmarker**: `0.23.x` â†’ `2.0.x` - Complete API rewrite with improved performance and standards compliance
- **html-pipeline**: `2.14.x` â†’ `3.0.x` - Simplified architecture, filter API changed
- **gemoji**: `3.0.x` â†’ `4.0.x` - Updated emoji mappings
- **Removed**: `extended-markdown-filter` (no longer maintained, incompatible with html-pipeline 3)

#### Breaking Changes for Advanced Users

1. **Custom html-pipeline filters no longer work**
   - html-pipeline 3.x has a completely different filter API
   - If you configured custom filters via `pipeline_config[:pipeline]`, they will not work
   - **Migration**: Rewrite custom filters using html-pipeline 3.x API (see [html-pipeline migration guide](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md))
   - The gem now handles markdown and emoji rendering directly

2. **Custom Renderer API changes**
   - If you implemented a custom renderer that directly uses CommonMarker:
   - **Old API**: `CommonMarker.render_html(string, :UNSAFE)`
   - **New API**: `Commonmarker.parse(string).to_html(options: {render: {unsafe: true}})`
   - Note the lowercase 'm' in `Commonmarker` in version 2.x

3. **Table of Contents filter removed from defaults**
   - The default `TableOfContentsFilter` is no longer applied
   - **Migration**: Implement a custom post-processing step if needed

#### What Still Works (and is Better!)

- âœ… GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, autolinks, task lists)
- âœ… **Emoji rendering** - `:emoji:` syntax like `:smile:` works out of the box
- âœ… Header anchors (automatically generated with IDs)
- âœ… Safe and unsafe HTML rendering modes
- âœ… Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- âœ… All existing templates and layouts
- âœ… Faster markdown rendering
- âœ… More standards-compliant HTML output

#### Why Upgrade?

- **Security**: Updates to latest stable versions with security patches
- **Performance**: commonmarker 2.x is significantly faster and more standards-compliant
- **Maintainability**: All dependencies are actively maintained
- **Modern**: Uses current Ruby ecosystem standards

#### Migration Guide

For most users with default configuration, this upgrade should be seamless. Advanced users should check:

- [ ] Do you use custom `pipeline_config[:pipeline]` filters? â†’ Rewrite for html-pipeline 3.x
- [ ] Do you have a custom `Renderer` subclass that calls CommonMarker directly? â†’ Update API calls
- [ ] Run full test suite after upgrade
- [ ] Regenerate documentation and visually inspect output

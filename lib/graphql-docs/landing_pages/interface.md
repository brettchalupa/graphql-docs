# Interfaces

GraphQL Interfaces are a sort of "parent object" from which other objects can "inherit" from. For example, `Stars` is considered an interface, because both `Repository` and `Gist` can be starred. An interface has its own list of named fields that are shared by implementing objects.

For more information, see [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Interfaces).

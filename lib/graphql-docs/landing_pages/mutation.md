# Mutations

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations.

The mutation type defines how GraphQL operations change data. It is analogous to performing HTTP verbs such as `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.

For more information, see [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Type-System).

# Objects

Objects in GraphQL represent the resources that you can access. Objects can contain a list of fields, which are specifically typed. For example, the `Repository` object has a field called `name`, which is a `String`.

For more information, see [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Objects).

# Unions

A union is a type of object that can represent one of many kinds of objects. For example, a field marked as a `ReactableUnion` could be a `CommitComment`, an `Issue`, an `IssueComment`, or a `PullRequestReviewComment`, because each of those objects can be reacted on.

For more information, see [the GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Unions).
